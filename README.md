```

git reset --hard HEAD               # Reset all changes back to last commit
git revert <commit_id>              # Make a new commit that undoes a previous one
```

---

## üåø Branching & Merging

```bash
git branch                          # List all branches
git branch <branchname>             # Create a new branch
git branch -d <branchname>          # Delete a branch
git checkout -b <branchname>        # Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout <branchname>           # Switch branches
git merge <branchname>              # Merge branch into current branch
git push origin --delete <branchname> # Delete a remote branch
```

---

## ü§ù Collaboration

```bash
git push                            # Upload changes to remote repo
git push origin <branchname>        # Push a branch to remote
git pull                            # Fetch and merge changes from remote repo
git pull origin <branchname>        # Pull branch changes from remote
git fetch                           # Download new data from remote but don‚Äôt merge
```

---

## üîç Inspection & Comparison

```bash
git log                             # Show commit history
git log --oneline                   # Brief log format
git show <commit_id>                # Show what changed in a commit
git diff                            # Show changes not yet staged
git diff <source_branch> <target_branch> # Show changes between branches
```

---

## üß≥ Stashing & Cleaning

```bash
git stash                           # Save dirty work and clean working directory
git stash list                      # List all stashes
git stash clear                     # Remove all stashed entries
git clean -f                        # Remove untracked files from working directory
```

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Tags & Releases

```bash
git tag <tagname>                   # Tag specific commits for release
git tag -a <tagname> -m "message"   # Create annotated tag
```

---

## üß† Advanced Manipulation

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit>            # Apply changes from a specific commit
git rebase <branch>                 # Apply commits from one branch onto another
git bisect                          # Find commit that introduced a bug (binary search)

### üîß What You Need to Do

1. **Place your two PDF files** in the root or a `/pdf` folder of your repository.
2. **Rename them accordingly**, e.g., `pdf1.pdf`, `pdf2.pdf`, or give them meaningful names like `git_cheatsheet_basic.pdf`.
3. **Update the download links** if your PDFs are stored elsewhere.

Would you like this in a downloadable `.md` file or copy it to a GitHub repo directly?
